# D13x demo88-nor NSH

This board port targets the ArtInChip D133CBS demo88-nor board and boots
openvela/NuttX from SPI NOR into the on-chip SRAM. The console is UART0 at
115200 baud.

## Build

Run from the openvela workspace root:

```bash
rm -rf cmake_out/demo88-nor_nsh
./build.sh contest2026_094_andy/board/d13x/demo88-nor/configs/nsh \
  --cmake -j8
```

The ELF entry point must be `0x30044100`, matching `pack/d13x_os.its`:

```bash
prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86_64/riscv-none-elf/bin/riscv-none-elf-readelf \
  -h cmake_out/demo88-nor_nsh/nuttx | grep 'Entry point'
```

## Pack

Copy the CMake outputs to the ArtInChip pack inputs, then run the packer:

```bash
cp -f cmake_out/demo88-nor_nsh/nuttx nuttx/nuttx.elf
cp -f cmake_out/demo88-nor_nsh/nuttx.manifest nuttx/nuttx.manifest

cd vendor/artinchip/pack
./pack.sh demo88-nor d13x
```

The burnable image is:

```text
vendor/artinchip/pack/prebuilt/d13x_demo88-nor_v1.0.0.img
SHA-256: 2b9c2a82bb45775f573e30976e207ba4d29322775fc9c60d212c1f6f139d0d77
```

The corresponding ELF sizes are `text=442876`, `data=1712`, and `bss=86304`.
Its load segment uses `0x30044000..0x300b09af` for file-backed data and ends at
`0x300c5adf` after BSS/stack allocation, within the configured SRAM region.

An `img2simg` error about `libselinux.so.1` only affects optional sparse image
conversion. The raw `.img` above is still generated and is the AiBurn input.

## Burn And Verify

1. Hold the board BOOT key while connecting USB.
2. Select the generated `.img` in AiBurn and burn the complete image.
3. Connect UART0 using 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, and no
   flow control.
4. Power-cycle the board after the burn completes.

A successful boot reaches:

```text
NuttShell (NSH)
nsh>
```

Check the expanded diagnostic shell before peripheral tests:

```text
nsh> ls /dev
nsh> ps
nsh> free
nsh> uptime
nsh> uname -a
nsh> fdinfo
```

Tab completion is enabled. The shell also provides `cat`, `cd`, `hexdump`,
`pidof`, `pwd`, `sleep`, `time`, and `usleep`.

Verify the onboard WAKEUP key:

```text
nsh> ls /dev
/dev/buttons must be present

nsh> button_test 15
button_test: /dev/buttons supported=0x00000001 initial=released duration=15 seconds
WAKEUP PRESS
WAKEUP RELEASE
button_test: presses=1 releases=1 final=released
```

The active-low PD.15 input uses GPIOD raw IRQ 71, both edges, an internal
pull-up, and 30 ms debounce in the standard NuttX button driver. PD.15 cannot
be used as I2S_MCLK while this input is enabled. This path has passed
real-board testing.

Verify the first WAKEUP power-management milestone separately:

```text
nsh> pm_test wake 30
pm_test: phase-1 wake standby, timeout=30 seconds
pm_test: display will turn off; press WAKEUP to resume
pm_test: CPU/PLL clocks remain running in this milestone
pm_test: WAKEUP resumed display after ... ms
pm_test: PASS; falling-edge wake and display restore verified
nsh> button_test 15
```

The command waits for WAKEUP release, arms PD.15 for falling-edge wake, turns
off PE.13, DE, and LVDS through `FBIOSET_POWER`, and restores the display and
normal both-edge button behavior afterward. It refuses to arm while
`/dev/buttons` owns the IRQ. This phase does not switch CPU or PLL clocks and
must not be described as light sleep.

Verify the separate PA.2/GPAI2 direction-key device:

```text
nsh> ls /dev
/dev/dpad must be present

nsh> dpad_test 20
dpad_test: /dev/dpad supported=0x0000000f initial=NONE raw=4095 duration=20 seconds
UP PRESS raw=...
UP RELEASE raw=...
DOWN PRESS raw=...
DOWN RELEASE raw=...
LEFT PRESS raw=...
LEFT RELEASE raw=...
RIGHT PRESS raw=...
RIGHT RELEASE raw=...
dpad_test: up=1 down=1 left=1 right=1 final=NONE raw=...
```

The second standard button lower half initializes ADCIM before GPAI2, applies
D13x calibration, polls at 10 ms, and requires three identical direction
classifications before reporting a transition. The common button upper half
then applies 30 ms debounce. PA.2 cannot be used as UART2 CTS in this setup.

Verify the watchdog first without resetting the board:

```text
nsh> ls /dev
/dev/watchdog0 must be present
nsh> wdt_test feed 8
wdt_test: feed mode, timeout=3 seconds, duration=8 seconds
wdt_test: feed=1 active=yes timeleft=... ms
...
wdt_test: PASS; 8 keepalives completed and watchdog stopped
```

Only after that passes, verify the reset path:

```text
nsh> wdt_test reset 5 confirm
wdt_test: reset mode armed for 5 seconds
wdt_test: no keepalive will be sent; board should reboot
```

The command intentionally sends no keepalive. The board must reboot into NSH
after about five seconds; omission of the final `confirm` makes the command
refuse the destructive test.

Verify the battery-backed RTC and its alarm interrupt:

```text
nsh> rtc_test show
nsh> rtc_test count 5
nsh> rtc_test set 2026-07-30T22:00:00
nsh> rtc_test alarm 5
```

The RTC is the NuttX system realtime source rather than a `/dev/rtc0` device.
`count` must report a 4..6 second advance and `alarm` must report raw IRQ 50
after approximately five seconds. Reboot and run `rtc_test show` for
warm-reset retention. Then remove main power with the coin cell installed and
verify the counter continues after power is restored. The set path waits for
`TCNT_INIT` completion; `show` and failed set operations print raw RTC state.
All RTC tests, including coin-cell retention, have passed on the board.

Verify QSPI0, MTD, and the `data` LittleFS partition:

```text
nsh> ls /dev
nsh> flash_test info
nsh> flash_test read 0 64
nsh> flash_test verify 0 65536
nsh> mount
nsh> ls /data
nsh> flash_test fs write
nsh> flash_test fs check
nsh> reboot
nsh> flash_test fs check
nsh> flash_test fs clear
```

`info` must report JEDEC ID `0x852018`, 16 MiB capacity, matching SFUD/MTD
geometry, and the parsed partitions. `read` performs a bounded hexadecimal
dump and `verify` requires matching CRC32 values from two reads. This command
contains no raw erase or write mode. `/dev/nor0` is an MTD inode, not a
directly openable character device; `flash_test` accesses its registered MTD
read operation without enabling BCH. Late boot mounts the existing 1 MiB
`/dev/data` LittleFS partition at `/data`; NuttX creates the mount-point inode
as part of `mount()`. The `fs` commands only operate on `/data/spi_test.bin`;
mounting, write/readback, reboot retention, and cleanup have passed hardware
testing.

At the prompt, run `help` to verify UART receive interrupts and task context
switching, not only console output.

Then verify the first board peripheral milestone:

```text
nsh> ls /dev
/dev/i2c2 must be present

nsh> gt911_test
GT911 found at 0x5d, product ID: 911. (39 31 31 00)

nsh> gt911_test touch 30
Touch monitor: 30 seconds, poll=10 ms, display=off. Tap targets, drag, and try multiple fingers.
FRAME points=1
  DOWN id=0 x=... y=... size=...
FRAME points=1
  MOVE id=0 x=... y=... size=...
  UP id=0 x=... y=...
```

On the earlier image, `0x14` returned product ID `911` and firmware `0x1060`.
After configuration, status still stayed `0x00` and PA.11 stayed high. The
board now performs the exact demo88 factory PA.10/PA.11 sequence, selects
`0x5d`, and downloads ArtInChip's complete 1024x600 five-point configuration
before registering I2C2. The default command also prints full configuration
checksum/fresh state and PA.11 input level. Raw touch mode
supports five points, runs for 15 seconds by default, and
accepts a duration from 1 through 300 seconds. Test a tap, drag to all four
corners, release, and multiple simultaneous fingers. Then rerun `hello_app`
to check that I2C polling has not regressed UART, timer, task creation, or task
exit. This raw diagnostic does not open `/dev/input0`, so it leaves the PA.11
GPIO IRQ disabled.

The factory `0x5d` reset sequence and raw touch reporting have passed hardware
testing. Run `gt911_test draw 30` to clear `/dev/fb0`, draw corner/center
targets, and show a separate colored trail for each track ID. Touch all five
targets for coverage PASS and use at least two fingers to verify
`max_points >= 2`. The final drawing remains on the panel after the command.

Verify the standard touchscreen separately. It publishes one primary pointer
for GUI use while `gt911_test` remains the five-point diagnostic. PA.11 uses
a falling-edge IRQ to request worker-side reads, with a 100 ms status poll as
a missed-edge watchdog:

```text
nsh> ls /dev
/dev/input0 must be present
nsh> getevent -t /dev/input0
```

Tap, drag, and release, then confirm standard DOWN/MOVE/UP samples. Stop
`getevent` with Ctrl-C before running `lvgl_test`; `/dev/input0` intentionally
allows only one reader. Its close log must show `irq > 0` and
`ready_frames > 0` for IRQ hardware acceptance.

Verify the onboard buzzer separately:

```text
nsh> ls /dev
/dev/pwm1 must be present

nsh> buzzer_test
Buzzer on: 4000 Hz, 50% duty, 1000 ms
Buzzer off
```

The optional form is `buzzer_test <frequency_hz> <duration_ms>`. Accepted
ranges are 100..10000 Hz and 1..5000 ms. Confirm that the buzzer becomes
silent after the command, then rerun `hello_app` and `gt911_test`. The default
effect has passed real-board testing.

Verify the J18 1024x600 LVDS framebuffer:

```text
nsh> ls /dev
/dev/fb0 must be present

nsh> fb_test
Framebuffer color bars: RGB565 1024x600, addr=0x40000000, stride=2048
```

The expected output is eight vertical bars: red, yellow, green, cyan, blue,
magenta, white, and black. This display image is build- and pack-verified.
PE.13 active-high panel/backlight enable after a 20 ms DE/LVDS stabilization
delay has passed hardware testing; the color bars still need to be recorded.
The framebuffer is black at boot, so execute `fb_test` before evaluating the
display.

Verify LVGL separately after the color bars are correct:

```text
nsh> free
nsh> lvgl_test
lvgl_test: LVGL 9.1.0, 1024x600 RGB565, /dev/input0, /dev/dpad, duration=30 seconds
lvgl_test: touch events button=... slider=... switch=... drag=...
lvgl_test: dpad up=... down=... left=... right=... focus=...; WAKEUP unused
lvgl_test: completed; final frame remains on the panel
nsh> free
```

Click the button, move the slider, toggle the switch, and drag the yellow
block. Press all four direction keys and require nonzero direction and focus
counters. UP/LEFT move to the previous focusable control; DOWN/RIGHT move to
the next. The focusable controls are only the six upper color swatches; the
middle button, slider, switch, and drag block remain touch-only. `/dev/buttons`
is not opened, because WAKEUP is reserved for system power management.

The test renders color swatches, fixed geometry, an animated progress bar, a
moving block, and a frame counter through LVGL's NuttX `/dev/fb0` backend. An
optional duration from 5 to 300 seconds may be supplied. GT911 touch drives
the interactive controls through `/dev/input0`; `/dev/dpad` supplies focus
navigation without taking ownership of WAKEUP.

Verify the onboard PDM microphones separately:

```text
nsh> mic_test record /data/mic.wav 3
nsh> ls -l /data/mic.wav
nsh> mic_test play /data/mic.wav
nsh> mic_test loop /data/mic.wav 3
```

PD.16 supplies DMIC clock and PD.17 receives DMIC data. Capture is fixed to
16000 Hz mono S16 for this validation and is registered as
`/dev/audio/pcm0c`. DMA request 14 uses channel 1 with two explicit,
32-byte-aligned 8192-byte cyclic descriptors. The earlier code captured one
period, producing a valid 4140-byte WAV, but DMA later observed zero descriptor
fields despite correct CPU-side links. The vendor cache-range implementation
used a fixed-register T-Head instruction without a matching compiler operand.
This image replaces it locally with constrained clean/invalidate operations
for both descriptors and capture buffers. Continuous three-second recording
and WAV finalization have passed on the board.

GMAC0 RMII Ethernet is implemented and registers `eth0` through the NuttX
network stack:

```text
GMAC0:       0x10280000, raw CLIC source 39
PHY:         RTL8201F, MDIO address 0
RJ45:        HR911105A
RMII:        PE.0..PE.5 and PE.7..PE.9, mux function 2
PHY reset:   PE.6 GPIO, active low
PHY clock:   PE.10 CLK_OUT2 25 MHz
RMII refclk: RTL8201F to PE.3, 50 MHz
```

The MDIO checkpoint (clocks, SYSCFG RMII external-clock mode, pinmux, reset
sequencing, PHY ID, link state) passed before packet DMA was enabled. RX/TX
descriptors and packet buffers require 32-byte alignment and use the same
compiler-constrained cache operations proven by DMIC. The SDIO Wi-Fi bring-up
for the module on SDMC0 lives in `app/wifi_test/`.
